## Overview
This project aims to design and develop an interactive, real-time dashboard that enables the police, including the D.P.O. (Divisional Police Officer) and department heads, to gain insights into key metrics related to crime. The primary focus is on tracking crime trends, monitoring crime response and resolution times, and enabling data-driven decision-making.


The goal is to allow police officers and decision-makers to access the latest crime data, analyze trends, monitor crime severity, and improve investigative processes such as skip-tracing. The dashboard will incorporate advanced data analysis techniques and visualizations to display actionable insights and enhance the efficiency of law enforcement efforts.

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, it contains 2000 rows, on key details about different type of crimes in Nigeria, it contains 15 columns which include states and cities where crimes are committed, the Date reported, Victims Age and Suspect Age, Victim Gender and Suspect Gender, who reported the crimes, Outcome, their response times and other relevant attributes.

## Dashboard 
The Nigeria Crime Rate dashboard provides a visual representation of the different crime typed across the states in Nigeria.
The dashboard reports was created on PowerBI. I utilize the use of Charts, Cards, Slicers, Page Navigation, DAX.
